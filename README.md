## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Marketing Analysis

### _1) Showcase the growth of Gsearch as the primary driver of business by pulling monthly trends for search sessions and orders._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand where the customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic
   - So what?
      1. Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaigns, or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates
      2. Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy
      3. Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high-converting traffic
   - Measured by?
      - website_session // order_id
         1. We use the utm parameters stored in the database to identify paid website sessions
         2. From our session data, we can link to our order data to understand how much revenue our paid campaigns are driving

The nonbrand campaign conversion rate remains relatively stable around 3-4%, suggesting a consistent level of effectiveness in converting nonbrand sessions into orders.     


### _3) Compare monthly trends of Gsearch traffic with other channels to understand their respective impacts on overall traffic._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to bid efficiently and use data to maximize the effectiveness of the marketing budget
   - So what?
      - understand which marketing channels are driving the most sessions and orders through the website
      - understand differences in user characteristics and conversion performance across marketing channels
      - Optimize bids and allocate marketing spend across a multi-channel portfolio to achieve maximum performance
   - Measured by?
      - To identify traffic coming from multiple marketing channels, we will use utm parameters stored in our sessions table
      - We will LEFT JOIN to our orders table to understand which of the sessions converted to placing an order and generating revenue

First, we'll check the different UTM sources and referrers to identify the incoming traffic.

![Sessions by Device Types](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/ff4882ea-9719-423c-9f1c-ac03760a6c77)

![Orders by Device Types](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/9628b4bc-3051-42c7-9234-cff0a7d33bcd)

![Conversion Rates Between Desktop and Mobile](https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/0bca869d-e4f7-4aa8-ba6c-246207f393b7)


- **Desktop vs. Mobile Sessions**: There is a clear trend of increasing sessions on both desktop and mobile devices over the months, with desktop sessions consistently higher than mobile sessions.

- **Desktop vs. Mobile Orders**: Similarly, desktop orders outpace mobile orders, indicating that desktop users are more likely to make purchases compared to mobile users.

- **Conversion Rates**: While desktop conversion rates remain relatively stable at around 4-5%, mobile conversion rates fluctuate, with some months showing significantly lower rates.

- **Conclusion**: Desktop devices dominate both sessions and orders, suggesting that desktop users are the primary drivers of traffic and conversions. However, it's essential to address the lower conversion rates on mobile devices to capitalize fully on this traffic source. Strategies aimed at optimizing the mobile user experience and improving mobile conversion rates should be prioritized to ensure a comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of traffic sources across different devices


## Website Performance Monitoring Analysis
### _5) Monitor and improve website performance by tracking session-to-order conversion rates monthly over the first 8 months._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand and optimize each step of your user's experience on their journey toward purchasing your products
      - look at each step in the conversion flow to see how many customers drop off and how many continue on at each step
   - So What?
      - identify the most common paths customers take before purchasing your products
      - identify how many of your users continue on to each next step in your conversion flow, and how many users abandon at each step
      - optimize critical pain points where users are abandoning, so that you can convert more users and sell more products
   - Measured by?
      - we will create temporary tables using pageview data in order to build our multi-step funnels
      - We will first identify the sessions we care about, then bring in the relevant pageviews, then flag each session as having made it to certain funnel steps, and finally perform a summary analysis

<img width="510" alt="eCommerce Q5" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/5d473d87-c48e-44e6-bf7d-a98ab0f5ee59">

## Conversion Funnel Analysis
### _6) Monitor and improve website performance by tracking session-to-order conversion rates monthly over the first 8 months._
Before diving into the data directly, let's list out the analysis process
- **STEP 0**: Have an overview of the conversion funnel path
   - Conversion funnel path:
      - /home ; /lander-1
      - /products
      - /the-original-mr-fuzzy
      - /cart
      - /shipping
      - /billing
      - /thank-you-for-your-order
<img width="173" alt="eCommerce Q7" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/1b54b1a5-3f32-476e-9b24-60057c90bdd1">

- **STEP 1**: Identify each relevant pageview for relevant sessions as the specific funnel step
- **STEP 2**: Create the session-level conversion funnel view
- **STEP 3**: Aggregate the data to assess funnel performance

   
   - Session Funnels
<img width="695" alt="eCommerce Q7-1" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/9ba4cf9c-4a5f-4fc1-821d-89b8fec6c5ea">

   - Click Through Rate Funnels
<img width="745" alt="eCommerce Q7-2" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/f6073b36-3191-4eb8-aa90-9ba675f1f020">

The custom lander page has better click-through rates than the original homepage.


## Revenue Analysis
### _7) Estimate the revenue generated from the search lander test by analyzing the increase in conversion rates and subsequent revenue._
   - Why do I want to know?
      - to understand the performance of the key landing pages and then test to improve the results
   - So what?
      - Identifying the top opportunities for landing pages - high volume pages with higher than expected bounce rates or low conversion rates
      - Setting up A/B experiments on your live traffic to see if we can improve our bounce rates and conversion rates
      - Analyzing test results and making recommendations on which version of landing pages we should use forward
   - Measure by?
      - To analyze landing page performance and compare multiple pages, we will again use temporary tables and write a multi-step 'data program'
      - We will find the first pageview for relevant sessions, associate that pageview with the URL seen, and then analyze whether that session had additional pageviews

Before diving into the data directly, let's list out the analysis process
- **STEP 0**: Find out when the new page /lander launched
    - The first_test_pageview ID is **23504** and was created at 2012-06-19 00:35:54
<img width="237" alt="eCommerce Q6" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/6d1248a6-5ec0-41f8-a2ba-5ea4da4e2d29">

- **STEP 1**: Find the first first_seen_landing_page_id for relevant sessions

- **STEP 2**: Identify the landing page of these relevant sessions
  
- **STEP 3**: Make a table to bring in the orders
  
- **STEP 4**: Find the difference between conversion rates
    - The conversion rate for **_/lander-1_** was higher at 4.06% compared to 3.18% for **_/home_**.
    - Therefore, **_/lander-1_** appears to be the more effective landing page in terms of driving conversions.
<img width="391" alt="eCommerce Q6 -1" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/8f504175-3481-4a6d-8c21-6cf685fd5269">

- **STEP 5**: Find out the last time when the traffic was sent to **_/home_**
    - To estimate the revenue generated by the new test lander page, we first identify the most recent appearance of the **_/home_** page. Subsequently, we calculate the total number of sessions since that occurrence.
    - The latest website_session_id is **17145**
    - After this session, the /home landing page is discontinued, and all landing pages are replaced with **_/lander-1_**.
<img width="259" alt="eCommerce Q6 -2" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/dca8d754-6f6c-4b5a-99a0-0d73c235b0f1">


- **STEP 6**: Count the total sessions after the last time **_/home_** page to estimate the revenue
<img width="143" alt="eCommerce Q6 -3" src="https://github.com/fangoaish/SQL__eCommerce-Analysis-for-Maven-Fuzzy-Factory/assets/51399519/bafabab1-258a-49b8-ae1e-c075903c8632">


- **STEP 7**: Calculate Average Revenue
    - 22,972 total website sessions for **_/lander-1_**
    - Conversion rate difference: 0.88%
    - 22,972 * 0.88% incremental conversion = 202 -> incremental orders since July 29th (roughly 4 months)
    - 202/4 = roughly 50 extra orders per month, not bad!
